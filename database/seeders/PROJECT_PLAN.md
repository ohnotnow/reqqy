# Reqqy

The aim of this application is to allow users to request new features in existing Laravel applications, or entirely new Laravel applications.

The idea is to let the user talk through the idea with an LLM, capture the requirements, and the further process to end up with well written PRD's and additionally do some research and investigation.

## Core Tech Stack

- Laravel v12
- Livewire v3
- FluxUI (front-end component system)
- Prism (for LLM calls - https://prismphp.com/core-concepts/text-generation.html)
- Pest (for tests)
- TailwindCSS

## User Journey

- User logs in and gets a choice between a feature request or a new application
- If a feature request, they get to pick from the list of existing \App\Models\Application's
- Now we create a new \App\Models\Conversation
- Then we enter a conversation flow - the user first, which goes to the LLM, back and forth until the LLM and User are satisfied the initial 'ask' has been captured.
- The user can now close the window.

## The Next Step

- The LLM takes the conversation and writes a PRD in a format which will be supplied
- That output is stored as an \App\Models\Document and associated with the conversation.
- Admin users (`is_admin` on the User model) are then emailed to let them know there is something to look at in the system.

## Phase Two

- When asked for a new feature in an existing application - a background agent is started and given access to the cloned repo for the codebase.  There will be some standard documentation for it to read and it will be free to investigate the codebase.  The agent will be tasked with figuring out where the new feature would fit, if the feature already exists (maybe the user just doesn't realise as it's buried away in a menu somewhere).
- That information is passed back to the main PRD writing LLM to inform it with some direct information that will help it figure out the scope and size of the request.
- When asked for a new application - a background agent will start up.  It will be asked to use it's web and research tools to investigate if there is a pre-existing solution that would fit the users requirements.
- The findings of that research are stored as an associated \App\Models\Document and also given to the main LLM to inform it's PRD.
