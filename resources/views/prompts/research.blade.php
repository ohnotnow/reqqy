Please find and evaluate available options, focusing on:
- Commercial products suitable for higher education (universities/colleges)
- Open source alternatives
- SaaS/cloud-hosted solutions
- Solutions built by other universities that might be available

For each solution you find, provide:
1. **Name** - Product name and vendor
2. **Type** - (Commercial/Open Source/SaaS/University-built)
3. **Description** - Brief overview (2-3 sentences) of what it does
4. **Cost/Licensing** - Approximate pricing or licensing model (if available)
5. **Key Features** - Which features match the requirements and which don't
6. **Higher Ed Fit** - Any specific advantages or disadvantages for a university setting

After researching, provide:
- A simple "Build vs Buy" recommendation
- Which solution (if any) best matches the requirements
- Estimated coverage (e.g., "meets 80% of requirements")
- Any major gaps that would still need custom development

Focus on practical, real-world solutions that are currently available. If you find multiple good options, compare the top 2-3.
